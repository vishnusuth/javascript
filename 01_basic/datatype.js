// DATATYPES
// in javascript that are serveral data types can use to store different types of data, some common data type includ :
// number(e.g. 10,3.14), string(e.g "hello",'world'), booleans(e.g true, false), arrays(e.g [1,2,33]), objects(e.g{name: "john", age:30})

//Primitive and objects
//                     In javascript, there are two main of data : Primitive and objets

//Primitives
//          Primitives are the simplest and most basic types in javascript, They include:-->
//          Numbers,Strings,Booleans,Null(a spical value that reperesent an absence of value),Undefind(a spical value that represents an uninitialized variables)

//Primitives are immutable, which means that once they are created, they cannot be changed. For example:

let x = 10;
x = 20;

//in this exmple, that value of "x" is changed from 10 to 20. However, this does not chnages that value of the primitive itself, but rather create a new primitve with the value of 20.
